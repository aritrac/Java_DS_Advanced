 * Author: Aritra Chatterjee
 * Problem: Give an algorithm for finding the union and intersection of BSTs.
 * Description: For union, we can convert both the BSTs to doubly linked list and then merge them
 * For intersection, we can perform an inorder traversal on one of the BSTs and store the node data in a hashmap.
 * After completion of the traversal of first BST, start traversal of second BST and compare them with hashtable
 * content
